📈 Stock Market Forecasting using Time Series Analysis
🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting stock market trends using time series analysis techniques. We explore historical stock market data, identify key patterns such as trends, seasonality, and volatility, and make both short-term and long-term predictions using statistical and deep learning models.
The project also delivers practical trading insights such as moving averages, volatility tracking, volume analysis, and simple buy/sell strategy simulations to enhance decision-making.

🎯 Objectives
Understand time series components: trend, seasonality, noise.
Perform data preprocessing and cleaning.
Implement and compare ARIMA, SARIMA, Facebook Prophet, and LSTM models.
Visualize stock market behavior using interactive dashboards.
Extract additional insights like volatility, moving averages, volume trends, drawdowns, and strategy signals.
Evaluate model accuracy using RMSE.
